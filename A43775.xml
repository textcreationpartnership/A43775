            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Scribes, Phariſees and Heathens, arrived to that paſs; but Evangelical Precepts and Preſidents extend a great deal further, as to teach us to imbrace a common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and neither to give, nor yet receive provocations to wrath.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62259:23"/> to become all things to all Men, that we may gain upon ſome; and in ſome caſes, and for ſome perſons, even to venture our Lives and Fortunes for them.</p>
               <p>Reveal'd Religion no where enterferes with, or controuls, that natural Religion, or Law of Nature which we are endued with, upon our entrance into the World; but all the Rules and Directions thereof are in affirmation and in inlargement of them; which is worthy our Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Religion <hi>(in ſano ſenſu)</hi> extends it ſelf all over the World, (as well as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel doth all over Chriſtendom) and is ſeated in the Conſcience, which is God's Vicegerent, that approves or condemns, accuſes or excuſes, all the actions of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual voluntary Agents; read <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. The fundamental part of Religion is co-natural to, and as inherent in, an Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Agent, as Reaſon it ſelf is; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whoever of them lives without ſome ſenſe of his ſubjection to, or dependance upon his Maker, is a moral Monſter; (which is the greateſt prodigy in the whole World) for an Oxe to know his Owner, and an Aſs his Maſter, and yet for a Man of higher ſenſes, and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual faculties, framed on purpoſe to reflect on, grope after, and underſtand
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62259:23"/> his own Conſtitution, Duty, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance; to diſown or be ignorant of a Deity, is an unaccountable thing in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality.</p>
               <p>Religion is (in ſhort) that thing which does diſtinguiſh a Man from a Brute. And Virtue or Piety is that which makes a Man appear to be an intellectual voluntary Agent, for nothing elſe can be ſuch; to wit, a thing that can chuſe or refuſe good or bad; and that owns his dependance upon a Sovereign goodneſs: without whoſe Care, Conduct, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentication, he could neither have nor continue in a Being. Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are only ſuch a ſort of exiſtency; and Virtue or Religion belongs properly to no body elſe in Nature, ſome ſhadows and umbrages there are of a ſeeming Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in inferior Entities, but they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not amount unto true Religion, becauſe they are only prompted by Inſtinct, or natural Laws, that oblige them to chuſe, or refuſe, what only is Decorous and Healthy, which are their <hi>ſumma bona,</hi> or chief good.</p>
               <p>But he that is truly Religious or Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, takes a real delight in regular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and rational operations, as homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneal and connatural to his Conſtitution and Nature.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62259:24"/> Being; and final and ultimate to them after their expirations. For Religion and Virtue muſt be conſidered off two ways; there's a Natural Religion, or Law of Nature ingroſt upon all Mens minds in the World, that diſcovers to them their derivation from and dependance upon a Supream Proprietor, and Benefactor to all effects and purpoſes; and perſuant thereof, is the reveal'd Religion in Holy Writ; and in Works of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, not at all thwarting or controul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling but confirming the Religion we call Natural. Wherefore I infer that (tho there be too too many Practical yet) there is not one Speculative Atheiſt in the whole World; tho ſome fools have been ſo ſilly as to ſay ſo, or would if they could conceive ſo, yet none have been ſo mad as to think and really believe (tho they lived without regard of him in the World) that there is no God. A Man can view nothing within him or without but what hath palpable indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Religion and Virtue, namely a relation to a Sovereign Goodneſs and Greatneſs; and conſequently more or leſs muſt induce him to acknowledge his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon, and Subordination to an infinite Independency; which concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his are radical Religion, and prompt him to Adoration, Homage and

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62259:25"/> conduct; but Man (the top of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) ſwerves from his Sovereign Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's Rules and Principles, and runs retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade (of courſe) in ſo much that its al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as hard to find a truly Religious <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſprudent</hi> amongſt mankind; as it was for <hi>Solomon</hi> to find a Prudent and Virtuous one among a Thouſand Women. Religion and Virtue are the Varniſh of the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and renders it Illuſtrious; but Vice and Enormity blots and ſtains it. A Wiſe or Religious Man keeps the Peace, but an Irreligious Perſon is like a common Barre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, that ſets the Family of God together by the Ears; a Boutefean or Incendiary. The former is a Man of Councel and of Conduct; the latter is a common Nuſance, not to be countenanced or endur'd with patience. Of the former that authentick Maxim is verified, <hi>ſcil.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62259:30"/> conſideration, conference, inſtruction, and applications by Prayer, and thankful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognitions of, and Praiſings for, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycings in ſuch Benefactions, Comforts, and Aids Divine, which we daily and hourly injoy, by that miraculous under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of our Saviour's paſſion, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion, together with the ſubſequent negotiations of the Holy Ghoſt, by the miniſtration of Angels, and the co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of him with our ſincere and ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, operations, in and about the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of our Salvation or Eternal fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity. He it is that works in us and for us, both a velleity, or willingneſs; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites and helps us forward to action, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly declares, The ſame Holy Spirit doth doubtleſs help our infirmities, and animates us in our defects of humane frailties; and as well in meditations of, as in application to him, prompts us to and prevents us in our perſuits after Eternal happineſs. He that lives without God in the World, ſurely lives without any ſenſe of this Divine ſuperintendence over and in us all; how can elſe our Saviours words be verified, That this Comforter (which is himſelf under another notion) ſhould teach and conduct us in the knowledge of whatſoever may conduce unto Eternal life. If we heed and regard him, queſtionleſs he is at hand, rebuking, reinforcing, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62259:30"/> inciting us to every good Word or Work. But this is a new (or rather unconſidered on) Doctrine, ſince our Saviours depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from us, who told us when he went away, that he wou'd not leave us deſtitute of the like aids and ſupplies, (as he affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded us when he was among us) to inform, to incourage, and to direct us in the dark, how to grope out our way to everlaſting hapineſs. He ſometimes by the Miniſtry of good Angels prompts us, ſometimes by the mediation of our rational and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate faculties ſuggeſts and influences us, ſometimes by the interpoſition of evil An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſuffers us to be tempted and prevented from many a good enterpriſe, or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, of his good pleaſure and free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention; all which Divine aids and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences, as procured for us, by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious merits and interceſſion of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, whereof no man can give a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular account any more than of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Wind, that blows when and where it liſteth, the impreſſion whereof we mortals find and feel, but can't unfold whence it comes, or whether it goes; but are ſure that every regenerate perſon do perticipate of thoſe operations, to all good effects and purpoſes, and without them are wholly impotent: This is that Lite that is kindl'd in all that are born, this is that Dove that brooding on the Waters, in ſix

               <p>But, whether every Individual Man and Woman have a Tutelar Angel, which hath by worthy and learned Divines, and others, from that expreſſion in holy Writ of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Angel; been ſo long controverted, that it remains a Polemical or moot-point to this day.

               <p>Whether they are propagated or infuſed has been another Polemical (or moot) point time out of mind, but (for my part) I can't imagine any good reaſon to evince the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, nor to invalidate the belief that they are <hi>(ex traduce)</hi> propagated; the original <hi>fiat</hi> of Almighty Power may reaſonably be ſuppoſed to infuſe at firſt ſuch an Energy as to produce an Homogeneal Derivation of the whole <hi>Compoſitum,</hi> and as a Candle kindles ten thouſand more by the ſame Light, which it receives by another Hand, without any diminution of its own flame: ſo may the production of infinite plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, of the ſame ſpecies, be apprehended, to commence without any miraculous or ſupernatural concurrence, ſince the Work of God's Creation is ceaſed.</p>
               <p>And as to the Tranſmigration of them, which the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> Philoſophers of old, and many other Modern Virtuoſoes ſince, have tenaciouſly aſſerted: I can by no means reconcile that Notion, to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Reaſon or Religion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hold it not <hi>operae pretium</hi> to attempt the refutation thereof.</p>
               <p>How and in what manner its ſubſiſtence is, after ſeparation from, until its reunion unto the Body natural; ſome probable conjectures from Divine Writ, and reaſon
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62259:33"/> may be plauſibly made, as that it is in a paſſive condition, or leſſer degree of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs than after the Reſurrection of the Body, and their mutual glorification, it can be capable of injoying, from that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of our bleſſed Saviour on the Croſs, to the Malefactor in his Crucifiction, <hi>That he ſhou'd be that very day with him in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe;</hi> which word we meet not with elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in Scripture ſave once, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. and may ſeem therefore to import ſome other degree of happineſs than may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be preſumed, Soul and Body in conjunction may perceive and injoy, its certainly receiv'd (if a ſanctifi'd Soul) into <hi>Abram</hi>'s boſom, or into its Creators cuſtody, care and poſſeſſion, as the ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring thereof into his Hands clearly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies; and muſt therefore needs be in eaſe, and happineſs; but we are as uncapable here to comprehend diſtinctly the nature and quality of its felicity, as we are of our circumſtances upon Earth, whilſt in the Womb.

                  </q> As <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid of Virtue, that if we did but view Her naked, we ſhould all be in love with her Features; ſo may we as truly ſay of Vice, that if we narrowly contemplated Her Deformity and ill Conſequences, we all ſhould <hi>primâ Facie,</hi> deteſt her at the firſt View, renounce and defie Her; and it's a meer palpable Cheat by Her Dreſs and Attire, that at any time She beguiles and ſeduces a thinking well-affected Agent. And obſerve it well, it is unnatural, as well as improper and unaccountable, for an intelligent and voluntary Agent to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto Obliquity, that is, to what is plainly pernicious and ruinous to his very Conſtitution and Principles. Its alſo leſs pains for any one to keep himſelf to rights, than it is to be Eccentrick and extravagant. To determine our ſelves (in the uſe of our
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62259:41"/> Liberty) to that which is right, or which is wrong, is that that denominates any Man Vicious or Virtuous, and its the frivolous Suggeſtions and Guiſes of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate part of the World, that biaſſes and perverts ſuch ſetled Determinations.—</p>
               <p>Sin and Vice interrupts the Entercourſe that wou'd otherwiſe be conſiderable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Men, between Men and Angels, between Man and Man; for it's the greateſt Deformity in the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Man had never been acquainted with Pain, Sorrow, or with Death, but for this.</p>
               <p>To be Vicious or Sinful, is to deviate and ſwerve from the Rule of Right, which is implanted in us radically as ſoon as we come into being. By that <hi>Hegemonicon,</hi> our Reaſon, we come to diſcern, and diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate judiciouſly between Wrong and Right, Good and Bad, Virtue and Vice; it is not a Quality that we bring with us into the World; but by ill Habits or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples we take it up here; although we are all Born and Conceived of ſinful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, yet we come into the World at firſt (as the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> well obſerve) as <hi>abraſa tabula,</hi> like a white piece of Paper, and no more inclinable to Vice than to Virtue, nor poſſibly half ſo much, if well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. So that (the Taint of <hi>Adams</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, notwithſtanding,) I am of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62259:41"/> that were it not for the contracted Contagion of ill Examples, ill Cuſtoms, and ill Educations that quickly become Habits (for the <hi>Logicians</hi> rightly aſſert, that Habits are acquir'd by repeated Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.) A Man (that is naturally Animal, <hi>Mite, Rationale, &amp; Religioſum</hi> too) wou'd eaſier receive virtuous Impreſſions <hi>(ab incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabulis)</hi> from his Cradle, than vicious, for the former are more homogeneal to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture than the latter, for vicious Men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, diſapprove (in cool Blood, we find) vicious Courſes in others, and chuſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt or to deal with virtuous rather than vitious ones in any Matters of importance; which very thing makes it out plainly, that Vice is Heterogeneal to the Nature and Conſtitution of Mankind, as well as ev'ry way pernicious. What a Diſeaſe or Sickneſs is to the Body, that is an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity to the Mind, a Man's Crop-ſick and uneaſie under Guilt of Sin; let him ſay what he pleaſe, if his intellectual Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are awake, and his Conſcience not ſeerd and ſtupified; but a juſt and ſincere man's as bold and healthy as a Lyon; whereas a Man of a vicious Converſation is never eaſie, but when in a Hurry, and impoſes upon, and cheats his own beſt Underſtanding; and whenſoe're he gives himſelf time to conſider and reflect, he's at his Wits End, and confounded; I will
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62259:42"/> but appeal to individual perſons on Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in this Point. Every one hath a Conſcience, and every one's Conſcience that liſtens to its Language doth unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably accuſe and excuſe him by fits and turns, according as he is Virtuouſly or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly affected in the general Courſe of his Life: Allowances are and will hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be made to Humane Failings and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages by Surpriſal, or Inadvertency in many caſes; but 'tis the Tenor and Courſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Ignorance of him, were not culpable, nor to live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Senſe of him Criminal, if he were not knowable, nor to be found out; for our Faith is founded upon natural Knowledge, for its impoſſible that we could ever give credit to we know not who, nor what; nor can there be any Obligation to that whereof we can't be ſenſible and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent; and in truth, we can ne're be at Hearts eaſe one hour in the World, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Senſe of, and Regard to him, nor without that, is any ſublunary Object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable, adequat or ſatisfactory; <hi>in ſano Senſu,</hi> and our very Faculties themſelves will ſhrivel up, and dwindle away, if not exerciſed on, and drawn out towards him; for to know him is Life eternal, in his Works as well as Appointments and Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions. This Argument every Man car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in his own Breaſt, that his Mind was made to move towards, and to delight in, and be converſant with him and his Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip in the World; but all this is not much to purpoſe, without a Submiſſion

               <p>The World was made for Man, and ſo was the Sabbath, and not Man for them, or their Sakes; wherefore, though it be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man's Temptation, as well as his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation in <hi>Statu Viatoris;</hi> that is, ſo long as he ſojounrs in it, yet was it not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to be any Man's whole Buſineſs, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to employ him about, or divert him: but to point him out unto, and to aſſiſt him conſiderably in other manner of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent and immortal Attainments.

               <p>An Opiniator has nothing to ſay for himſelf, but an arbitrary Impetuoſity, that gives him an Enthuſiaſtical Impulſe, ſo that he can't as a moral Agent, expect any other Conſequence, than hap at a Venture may produce; but a ſerious ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Agent hath other motives Ends and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations; whether he be miſtaken by his Meaſures or not, he may plauſibly look the World of Mankind in the Face, and expect to be further incouraged, which an Opiniator has no pretence unto at all.</p>

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62259:56"/> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> the beſt and worſt Adjuncts that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to humane Nature. Of the firſt, we have the greateſt Pattern that ever was in the World, our Lord and Saviour. Of the latter, the Devil is the beſt Inſtance that I can think of, who loſt eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs (upon that account) irrecoverably. An humble man is too hard for the Devil. A proud man is the Devil's Darling, and fit for any thing of monſtrous Immorality, and as eaſily tempted to prevaricate, as the other difficult. He that is not a very hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Perſon, can neither be a wiſe man, nor a true Chriſtian. Even to a proud man himſelf is an humble man acceptable, but a proud man to none but the Devil; for it's our Saviour's Motto, <hi>ſſ. meek and lowly,</hi> but it's <hi>Lucifer</hi>'s Emblem, <hi>ſſ. proud and lofty:</hi> And tho' this be <hi>Communis eruditio,</hi> that is, vulgar Learning, yet is it as hard to find a man of that Character, as it was in <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s days to find a virtuous Woman, to wit, not one of a thouſand.</p>
               <p>An humble man is tractable and docible, converſable and uſeful; but a proud is <hi>Tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luris inutile pondus;</hi> inſignificant and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom; one that can't tell what he would be at; a nothing to purpoſe. A proud man is a moral Prodigy, and the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable Excreſcence in Nature; a thing ſenſleſs and irrational; an high-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Author; fears nor loves not God nor
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62259:56"/> Man, but is his own Center, and Eccen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick to the whole World beſides.</p>
               <p>The moſt High defies and ſcorns the proud, but hath declared to eſpouſe the humble, and to teach and encourage the meek and lowly. A thinking ſerious man might well wonder what any man can be proud of, if he conſiders but whence and how he came into Being, and of what compounded, and how quickly he will be reduced to Duſt, and what that is which he can call his own, and what an indigent Creature he is, and every way dependant, and a borrower. Pride is an uſurped Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation, of ſomewhat or other that we have no property in at all; but Humility is a due ſenſe and opinion of our precarious and neceſſitous Conſtitutions and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. Beſides it is as well unnatural, as unwarrantable and ridiculous, for any man under any Circumſtances to be proud and ſelf-conceited, as if he were or had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more than any of his fellow-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures can pretend to; but Humility ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders a man uſeful and acceptable unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to all Mankind. It's rarely to be found that a proud man lives happily, or dies honourably; he's uneaſie to himſelf, (upon reflexion) as well as to all that he converſes with, for he's naturally conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious; but an humble man is at peace and in ſafety with the whole World. A proud
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62259:57"/> man is impatient; an humble very patient under all kind of Circumſtances, which is next to Charity, the predominant Virtue of all: wherefore it's truly ſaid,
<q>
                     <l>Superanda omnis Fortuna ferendo eſt.</l>
                  </q> Ill Accidents are conquer'd by enduring.</p>
               <p>And to this purpoſe <hi>Horace</hi> dictates ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently:
<q>
                     <l>Durum eſt; ſed levius fit patientiâ</l>
                     <l>Quicquid corrigere, eſt nefas.</l>
                  </q> Tho' it's a difficult Leſſon, yet thereby are all Burdens made lighter abundantly. An impatient or proudman is a moral mad man, <hi>Laeſa patientia fit furor:</hi> when his patience is worn out, he becomes furious or mad; hence they are conjoyn'd by our Saviour, <hi>Be humble and bear my yoke.</hi> But a proud and impatient Sinner grows of courſe fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, deſperate, and haughtier, indocible, and troubleſom both to himſelf, and the whole Family of God.</p>
               <p>Pride is the firſt and worſt Sin in the World, and older than the World it ſelf; Humility the laſt (tho' not the leaſt) Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: we put it on to be clothed with it; it's like a Girdle, that fortifies and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves all the other, to which a promiſe of Inſtruction is annext; but the proud reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſent away empty. An humble man is fit Company for any man; a proud for none, becauſe he really (whatever he pretends) accounts himſelf to every man
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62259:57"/> better: the humble and patient is willing to converſe with any man, Publican or Sinner, tho' he be counted a Glutton, or a Wine-bibber, all's one.</p>
               <p>It's much to the purpoſe to ſuggeſt to you the Motto of my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Cook, Patiens qui prudens,</hi> that is, He that is a patient man, is a right <hi>Juriſprudent.</hi> Of the ſame Religion is (no doubt of it) our Author, that thus exerts himſelf to his Son. <hi>Nullum numen abeſt ſi ſit prudentia juris,</hi> here ſeems very applicable. A man of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience or Humility (which at this time of day is all one) is one that has the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the whole World; but a proud and impatient Fellow is not fit Company for a Tailor, or an honeſt Cobler. Let but any man obſerve the Temper of a man greatly proud and impatient, (for he that is one muſt be the other) and he'l find that he neither ſteers an eaſie Courſe to his own ſatisfaction, nor his Neighbours; ſo that the World may truly count him a burden to them, and have a good riddance of him, whenſoever he is departed: but a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient humble man is lamented and miſs'd.</p>
               <p>Patience, I confeſs, is a hard Chapter to read in ſome Caſes; as when one's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated and juſtly incenſed by his own Fleſh and Blood, eſpecially Dependants and Inferiors, after perhaps he hath a long time exerted all the Clemency, Indulgence, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62259:58"/> hoſpitality imaginable, however the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick Laureat Heathen Poet has long before us obſerved it, that as I ſaid before
<q>
                     <l>Durum eſt,</l>
                     <l>—Sed Levius fit patientiâ,</l>
                     <l>Quicquid corrigere, eſt nefas.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>To bear what we can't juſtifie our ſelves to correct, nor the Aggreſſors to inflict, is very hard, but yet our Load becomes much the lighter, by enduring it with humble Patience, and till an humble man's Patience be ſtretched upon the Tenter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooks exceſſively, he will not be outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, notwithſtanding the old Maxim of <hi>Laeſa Patientia fit furor.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>When Patience has been long time hurt,</l>
                  <l>Mildneſs it ſelf will have a flurt.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Humility and Patience is the greateſt Poſſeſſion in the World, to purchaſe a Man Credit and Eaſe both within and without him. But an Impatient proud Fellow, is ſcorn'd both by them that are his Rivals, and all Men elſe, and is really <hi>telluris inutile pondus,</hi> the moſt inſignificant Tool in Nature, and a Burthen to the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe.</p>
               <p>No Man can be Wiſe, nor at hearts Eaſe, no Happy, either in this neather World, nor in the upper Regions hereafter, that is not Humble and Patient, both in Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as well as Adverſity. In all Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and ther's leſs to be ſaid in Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62259:58"/> of Pride, than any Vice and Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; beſides he's a Tyrant, an Uſurper, and every ways uncouth and unaccepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, who is Impatient and Proud, and no good colour of reaſon can be giv'n for it; as for Covetouſneſs, and Wantonneſs, and Prodigality, and other Enormities there in many caſes may be ſome given.</p>
               <p>So then, a right <hi>Juriſprudent</hi> is a Man of Senſe and Reaſon; an intellectual moral Agent, that is well acquainted with, and practiſes the Laws of God, of Nature and of Reaſon, that acts not <hi>pro imperio,</hi> arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, but humbly, honeſtly, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly converſes with all ſorts of Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, whether in <hi>formâ Pauperis,</hi> or <hi>Divitis,</hi> Rich, or Poor, Publicans or Sinners, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies the future and eternal, as well as the ſecular and preſent Caſes and Concerns of both himſelf and them, <hi>pro Ratione rei,</hi> according to the Reaſon of the Thing. He is Juſt and Generous, Compaſſionate and Charitable, and well affected to all Men, and Sometimes arrives to that Attainment of Juriſprudence, as to make him an Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch for the Kingdom of Heaven; upon which Principles and Practiſe, is founded that inward and outward Peace, Content and Satisfaction of Heart in all his Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Reverſions, as well as Progreſs and Improvement in the Municipal Laws of that Realm, where he Reſides, Profeſſes and Practiſes.</p>

               <head>XIII. <hi>De Amore &amp; Amicitia.</hi> Of Love and Friendſhip.</head>
               <p>TRue Friendſhip with God and Man, is our higheſt Priviledge and Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>John.</hi> 15.15. Our Saviour calls his Diſciples Friends, that is, ſuch unto whom he'l communicate his Secrets; it's the end of all Goſpel Diſpenſations, to continue in his Love, and to comply with his Will and Commands, for <hi>amicorum preces ſunt imperio,</hi> a Friends Requeſts have the force of a Command. Friendſhip is the moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and inviolable Bond in the World, and far more conſiderable than any natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Tye whatever.</p>
               <p>No greater evidence can be of our true Love to God and Religion, than our Love to our Neighbour. All true Friendſhip is
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62259:66"/> founded in Virtue or Religion; our Friend <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſleeps, ſaid our Saviour, and God calls <hi>Moſes</hi> his Friend. <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. A Friend loves at all times, and is neerer than a Brother, ſaid <hi>Solomon.</hi> What greater Copy can we write after than our bleſſed Saviour, who took our Nature (and not Angels) on him; who dyed for us, while his Enemies; who help't and healed both Soul and Body; who inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds for us in our Abſence, and who, in his Abſence, ſends a Proxy to be our Comforter as well as Conductor in our Journey toward thoſe heavenly Manſions? So ſhou'd we love one another, he has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 5.10. an Underſtanding that we may know him, and 1 <hi>J.</hi> 3. A Power, (by entertaining of him) to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Sons of God, and be Friends with him and the whole Family of God below. Take we a very ſhort view of his frank and friendly Converſation in the World, for our Example and Imitation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His Doctrine (all along) was to (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive Man, and) convince him of the Truth, to free him from Errors, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures, and vain Traditions, healing Bodies, informing the Minds in the true Way to Life and Happineſs, Temporal and Eternal, by publick Teaching, by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Conference, praying with and for them, Sympathizing with them in Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62259:66"/> grieving at their Obſtinacy and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitancys, induring all Indignities that Malice could inflict. Here's true Love and Friendſhip to purpoſe, and after all, to lay down his Life to reconcile Man to God and to one another. Well might St. <hi>John</hi> be amazed, and cry out, <hi>Behold what manner of Love and Friendſhip?</hi> This Love and Good-will extends to all Men; but Friendſhip muſt needs be reſtrained to few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſuch as we are very well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, for it's the <hi>Elixir,</hi> or the Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence of Love and Kindneſs, and a top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Branch of the Tree of Charity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amicitia ſemper pares accipit aut facit,</hi> is an old and a true Axiom, Friendſhip ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther finds or makes an Equaliiy between the Partys ſo ingaged; no Priority nor Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation takes place in ſuch a ſort of Union of Affections as this conſiſteth in; it was the Saying of a late incomparable Divine deceaſed, <hi>That the Face of his Friend was (to him) the Sun in the Firmament;</hi> and ſurely, but for the ſake of Friendſhip, and the Satisfaction accruing by it, it were not worth the while to be here for nothing on Earth, that has not an Eye of that in its Contexture, can be grateful and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Man's Mind.</p>
               <p>God is Love in the Abſtract, and every thing that taſtes not of it, is moſt unſavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and inſignificant. <hi>Magnes amoris Amor,</hi>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:62259:67"/> we commonly find to be true; that is, Love is the Loadſtone of reciprocal Love; we can hardly chuſe but love him, that firſt loves us; but that degree of Love that makes true Friendſhip, has ſo many Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients requiſite to make it right, that its ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rare to fiind a real Friend among a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of good Chriſtians now a days; ſelf Intereſt and Jealouſie is ſo prevalent and Epidemical, though in good earneſt, it's the trueſt and moſt warrantable Self-Love in the World, to love our Brother as our ſelves, which is a mighty Indication of our Love to God, and to our ſelves (in the beſt Senſe) 4 <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. <hi>Solomon</hi> aſſures us, that two are better than one, <hi>plus vident Oculi, quàm Oculus.</hi> Two Eyes diſcern better than one and a By-ſtander, ſees (of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) more than a Gamſter, and a Man being commonly the worſt Judge in his own Caſe, hence it follows, that a Friend is moſt Neceſſary in point of Councel and Direction, and in point of Regulation of Paſſions; for with the Frenzy of Anger and Vexation, or the Ague of Hopes or Fears, or the Fevor of Love, or the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of Envy; a Mind (when he's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone) is ſeldom undiſtemper'd; the ſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble friendly Life, is alſo beneficial for our Aſſiſtance in our Labours, which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted thereby with greater Safety, Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and Succeſs, 27 <hi>Prov.</hi> As Perfumes
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62259:67"/> chear the Heart, ſo doth the Sweetneſs of a Friend; for as a learned Biſhop well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, the Communion of Saints, is (next to the Favour of God, and the Comforts of a good Conſcience) the greateſt Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Happineſs we can injoy on this ſide Heaven. And that conjugal Relation of Man and Wife (for which, all other Relations are to be quitted) is only valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble upon this account, as they are Friends, and without this, they are but empty Names, as Biſhop <hi>Wilkins</hi> well obſerves; who reckons four principal Qualifications of true Friendſhip.</p>
               <p n="1">1. True Love (which is the Bond of Perfection.)</p>
               <p n="2">2. A wiſe Freedom of imparting Thoughts.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Patience, for angry Men are neither good Councellors nor Comfortors, and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> diſſwades the contracting of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with ſuch an one.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Conſtancy, to adhere in Adverſity, as cloſe or cloſer than in Proſperity; the Witch of <hi>Endors</hi> Example to <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. is a juſt Reproach to a perfidious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant Friend.</p>
               <p>Love by the Schoolmen is diſtinguiſht three ways.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amor, Benevolentiae,</hi> that is good liking of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amor, Complacentiae,</hi> that is, better pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with.</p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:62259:68"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amor Amicitiae,</hi> that is, firm Friendſhip, which is the Superlative Degree of Love and Kindneſs.</p>
               <p>Benevolence is due to all Mankind.</p>
               <p>Complacence and Delight to Relations and Neighbours.</p>
               <p>Friendſhip, only to ſuch as are intimate with us, as our own Souls, and tempered exactly to us in Diſpoſition and Principles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ullus ad amiſſas ibit Amicus opes;</hi> though a real Friend will appear (to chuſe) in greateſt Exigencies and Indigencies. It's ſo rare and different to find ſuch Friends (in this Age) that it's commonly ſuppoſed by the Vulgar, that it's but a Chimera, and no ſuch thing in <hi>rerum Natura.</hi> It's the Advice and Opinion of a learned Biſhop of the Church of <hi>Ireland,</hi> lately deceaſed, that there's <q>two Faults only that are not Venial and Pardonable in true pretended Friendſhip (for to real it belongs not)</q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <q>1. The revealing of a Secret.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <q>2. A Treacherous Blow, which ruines the Vitals, and diſſolves the Union, and is a Divorce a <hi>Vinculo;</hi> for true Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is the greateſt practical Honeſty, and Ingenuity in the World.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It's the Nerves and Sinues of Humane Converſation, inſomuch that you find no Body without a pretended Friend; but one that is a Frigat of the firſt Rate in Friendſhip, is rarely to be met withal.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62259:68"/> However, herein I appeal to all Mankind, the very Bruits have among themſelves a conſiderable Semblance of true Friendſhip, <hi>Saevus inter ſe Convenit Urſus,</hi> the very Bares and Bores have a League of Amity between themſelves, and therefore it would be miraculous (to purpoſe) if moral and intellectual Agents ſhould not <hi>inter ſe convenire in aliquo tertio,</hi> as the Schoolmen ſay, that is, have a Confederacy of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with a third Party at leaſt.</p>
               <p>True Friendſhip is the very Vitals and Radicality of Commerce and Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; ſo that there can be no Dealings amonſt Men without a violent Preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (which our Law calls a half-proof) of it every where; but for a Man to dare to ſacrifice both Life and Limb for another, is not (now a days) to be found, perhaps out of <hi>Utopia.</hi> However, that ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Concord and Amity is both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and expedient (though not common) is a Veracity beyond all diſpute. It's an old Trite, but not deſpicable Axiom, that <hi>Amicus certus in re incertâ cernitur.</hi> A true ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Friend is experimentally found and tryed, when a Man's at a Non-plus, or at a Loſs what to do next. Councel and Conduct are the two chief Particularities of Friendſhip, and that is chiefly requiſite when a Man is in Diſtreſs and Adverſity; although in Proſperity there be ſingular
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62259:69"/> Uſe and Advantages of this kind of Love. But remember withal, that he that is not his own Friend, can't have another, for there are a ſort of degenerate Souls in the World, that will neither be their own Friends, nor any bodies elſe. Such as are ſunk into Senſe, and hate to (or delight not in the) exerciſe of their Homogeneal and intellectual Faculties, but center in themſelves and their own Humours; whereas <hi>(in ſano Senſu)</hi> on a true account, it's the righteſt Self-Love in the World, to love God and your Neighbour, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially your Friend, your (next) Self.</p>

               <p>Numerous and great are the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Receſs and Solitude, (which are not to be met withal abroad) four of the principal whereof are, To be Soveraign of his own Time, his own Company, his own Buſineſs, and to be out of Harms way: And accordingly we find theſe four are the ſecureſt and innocenteſt Junctures of our Lives: 1.

               <p>Our bleſſed Saviour converſed as often in the Deſerts, as with the Multitude: whence we may naturally infer, That So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude or Retirement is of as vaſt uſe and advantage, (by turns at leaſt) as univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Converſe with the World, for which purpoſes chiefly we came into Being.

In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable are the Advantages of any ſort of ſteddy Employment; it diverts a Man from miſchievous and expenſive Hazards; it refreſhes his Mind with reflection on Pains and Time laudably ſpent and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted

               <p>An idle Fellow can't tell what to be at next, which is a worſe ſort of Pain than a Fatigue or Toil at an Oar of Buſineſs.

But it's a topping Point of Juriſprudence, to be very well employ'd, though it's every ones Duty to follow ſome or other Employment, for we came not into the World to be idle; that's both unnatural and immoral; every way unaccountable; and its a topping Point of Juriſimprudence (to be ſo far at a Loſs at any

Whereby 'tis demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrable, that Generoſity or Liberality (which is the ſame thing) is one of the moſt commendable Accompliſhments that belongs to any Man in the World; for a Liberal Man is neceſſarily Charitable and Hoſpitable, which Sacrifices are ſuch as we are <hi>(jure Divino)</hi> aſſured God is well pleaſed with, wherefore did St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who affirms the ſame, give us a great Caution to be ſure not to forget this Faculty of Communicating.</p>
               <p>Prodigality and Nigardlineſs or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, are the two Extreams of Liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62259:76"/> If any one ask me a Character of that Man that I would chuſe to make a Friend off, it would be one that is Juſt and Generous; tow ſhort Words, but very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive; for the former Appellation implies one that is only exact in commuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Juſtice, not to defraud or cheat you (as in common parlance, <hi>&amp; ex vi termini,</hi> it imports) but one that is univerſally So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Righteous and Godly; and thus far a Publican, a Scribe, or a Phariſe might proceed in Juriſprudential Learning; and yet miſcarry at laſt; but to be Generous and Liberal, as well as Juſt and righteous, implies Hoſpitality and Charity intenſly; which Properties, he that wants, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver on good grounds expect to be happy, becauſe, whate're beſides he is wanting in, if he be defective here, he's a Nugatory Thing, a tinkling Cimbal, and a thing of no ualue; nor in a ſperate Condition. A generous <hi>Juriſprudent</hi> is a Perſon of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Conſcience, Generoſity and Charity, which is but one Branch of the Tree of Liberality (but a great one) we cannot (ſcarce) in any quality, more imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate our Soveraign Law-giver than herein, that ſhines and rains on Good and Bad; but a Man that's Covetous, is both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly injurious to himſelf, and to all the World about him, for he hords up, and inhibits that Talent which is none
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62259:77"/> of his own, to that purpoſe. Every Man in the World has a ſurplus: the generous Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow in the Goſpel, that caſt her Mite (her All) into the Bank of Charity, was record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed juſtly for a Generous, as well as very Charitable Soul, for our Example, nothing is more odious in Law, nor more heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal in Nature, than ingroſſing of what is communicable <hi>(pro re natâ)</hi> in the nature of the Thing, and that is Wealth, which is no farther uſeful to any Man, than dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed by the Regrators and Ingroſſors thereof. The ſpeculative Letchery of a Covetous Perſon, is an unintelligent thing to a <hi>Juriſprudent,</hi> or a Man of conſiderate Senſe and Reaſon; not but that it's abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely adviſeable to provide againſt the miſadventurs and contingences of humane Affairs, but yet with Juriſprudence, and due Conſideration, and Mathematical Meaſures, our Saviour ſaid it was next un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Impoſſibility, for a Rich, that is (in his Senſe there) a Covetous Man, to go to Heaven, as it was for a Camel or (rather to follow the Original) a Cable to be threaded in a Needles Eye. For in good earneſt, the liberal Man is only rich, that is, hath enough for his preſent Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, and future Expectancies, and to ſpare for the univerſal Intereſt of Mankind, with whom he correſponds; which, is doubting of God's Providence,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:62259:77"/> diffident of all Succeſs, and jealous of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body about him. A <hi>Juriſprudent</hi> of for its well known, who aſſured us, that Riches conſiſted not in abundance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Heart to make a proper uſe of it, which moſt overgrown Wealthiſts want.</p>
               <p>The true Rich Man, is he that hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to bound his Appetites and to ſpare, that's a great Soul, and a right <hi>Juriſprudent.</hi> It's Diffidence and Diſtruſt, and it's a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillanimous Soul that's Hidebound, Penuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Covetous, for its Con-tranatural and Ignoble, Sordid, and unworthy of ſo Magnanimous a Creature as Man <hi>(ab Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine)</hi> was made, and its obſervable, that the Remains of a Covetous Man ſeldom or never proſper in their Succeſſions; <hi>vix gaudet tertius heres,</hi> ſcarce the third Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration enjoy them; but <hi>(vice verſâ)</hi> the contrary is as remarkable of a Liberal Man's, becauſe the former is groſe Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the latter true Piety; whereunto are annexed the Promiſes and Benefactions as well of this World as the next.</p>
               <p>A Liberal Man (<hi>Solomon</hi> tells us) will be Fat, the other contrariwiſe, Lean as a Rake; or (as the Cheſhire Proverb is) <hi>as if he ſuckt his Dam through an Hurdle.</hi> He dotes on, and pants after the Duſt of the Earth upon the Head of the Poor, and is <hi>Solomons</hi> great Fool, and the moſt egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Slave in the World; the Ground of

                  <hi>MAnes ſuos quiſque patimur,</hi> ſaid the great <hi>Horace.</hi> Our Urns and Ends are as certain as our Beginnings: <hi>Orimur, morimur,</hi> All of us that live muſt die; which fatal word to the unthinking Vulgar is the moſt formidable in Nature, and by the Heathen called ſo; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But ſome of the more thinking of them have had a rarer Notion of it, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Dii celant homines, ut vivere durent,</hi>

                  <q>
                     <l>That Men may endure to live's the Reaſon why,</l>
                     <l>The Gods conceal, how ſweet it is to die.</l>
                  </q> And the divine Philoſopher <hi>Seneca</hi> ſeem'd to be much of that Mind, when he ſaith, that, <hi>Pompa Mortis magis terret quam mors ipſa,</hi> that the Circumſtances of our Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are more frightful than Death it ſelf: and Dr. <hi>Brown</hi> wonders any wiſe Man was afraid of it; he profeſſes himſelf to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſham'd to ſee ſo ſudden and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a Change made in a Carcaſs: it's as natural to die as to be born, ſaith Sir <hi>Fra. Bacon,</hi> and therefore ought not to be ſo dreadful. So that a <hi>Juriſprudent</hi> being well apprized of the Law of Mortality, ſo lives, that he's neither afraid nor aſham'd to die,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62259:80"/> whenſoever his great Soveraign, that put him into Being, thinks fit to recal him out of it.</p>
               <p>It's true that Life is a mighty Bleſſing, and a living Dog is better than a dead Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but in compariſon with the Ends of Life, and Conſequences of Death, it's not worth the talking of.
<q>
                     <l>Quis propter Vitam vivendi perdere Cauſas</l>
                     <l>Velle poteſt?</l>
                  </q> could a Heathen ſay.
<q>
                     <l>Who for Life's ſake, wou'd ever quit the Cauſe</l>
                     <l>Of Living, by his fundamental Laws.</l>
                  </q> Eſpecially believing, that a better Life, and infinitely more to purpoſe, will be ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to every one that dies a <hi>Juriſpru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Illi Mors gravis incubat,</l>
                     <l>Qui notus nimis omnibus,</l>
                     <l>Ignotus moritur ſibi.</l>
                  </q> ſaid the Tragedian <hi>Seneca</hi> excellently well, <hi>ſſ.</hi> Death cannot be really formidable to any, but ſuch as are too well (and notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly) known to the World, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not themſelves. <hi>Cogi qui poteſt, neſcit mori,</hi> (ſaid he too.) That Man can't tell how to die, that can be compell'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, (note that!) For in many Caſes Death is more eligible than Life to a <hi>Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent;</hi> but a <hi>Juriſimprudent,</hi> or <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> is afraid of his own Shadow, and can't tell you why he does dread to die.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:62259:80"/>
                  <l>He that lives well, need not fear to die,</l>
                  <l>Becauſe he knows good reaſon why,</l>
                  <l>He leaves Time for Eternity.</l>
               </q>
               <p>While a <hi>Juriſprudent</hi> is preſent in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, he is (all that while) abſent from the Lord; which I take to be the chief Reaſon, why that Chief Juſtice of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> St. <hi>Paul,</hi> deſired rather to be diſſolv'd than not, as to himſelf; but as to the care of the Churches, and their edification by his Function (for a ſeaſon) which was the great Province he was charged withal, he was contented to endure to live a while longer. The ſager ſort of the Heathen themſelves had arriv'd to this Metaphyſical Point, That to be in <hi>Statu ſeperato,</hi> from the cumberſom Body, was much more eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, in it ſelf ſingly conſider'd, from the benefit of Mankind, than their longer reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Body.</p>
               <p>Wherefore duly conſider'd, and juriſprudentially, what we are, and whither we tend, we can ſhew no cauſe why we ſhou'd be at all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may'd at Death. Indeed if we had no further Aſſurances of future Felicity, the Caſe were alter'd; but who can be happy too ſoon? or who that prudentially conſiders all the Weal and Woes of humane Life to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, does not judge him the happieſt man that is well extricated out of the body?

                  <l>This is no Riddle unto him that's wiſe</l>
               </q>
               <p>Life indeed is all in all, (when all's ſaid) but to exchange a worſe for a better Life, is more than all that can be ſaid, <hi>è contra,</hi> againſt it. It's better not to be, than to be miſerable all agree; but if we are morally certain of an eternal Life, he muſt needs be <hi>(non Compos mentis)</hi> out of his Wits, that is loth to die. As Death is an extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhment of all our Faculties, and a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce of Soul and Body; indeed it's formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable; but if we as <hi>Juriſprudents</hi> look on't but as an Emancipation, or Gaol-delivery, and as a future State, to which <hi>(ab initio)</hi> at firſt we were framed, it is rather what we ſhould long for and covet, than be ſhy of, or dread. A <hi>Juriſprudent</hi> argues thus:
<q>
                     <l>If I am here but by the By;</l>
                     <l>If it's impoſſible (long) Death to fly;</l>
                     <l>If Life eternal be to me hard by;</l>
                     <l>If no man can 'gainſt it ſhew good Cauſe why;</l>
                     <l>Within a little while I muſt needs dye:</l>
                     <l>To be tranſlated hence, wherefore ſhould I</l>
                     <l>Be <hi>al a mort</hi> before-hand, or be ſhy.</l>
                     <l>If <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> approved beſt</l>
                     <l>Of Diſſolution, why ſhould not the reſt</l>

                     <l>Reſolve the Point? It is but a Demiſe,</l>
                     <l>No Prince or <hi>Juriſprudent</hi> ever dies.</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaid very true, that</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Non eſt vivere, ſed valere vita.</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>He that's in pain, and no health hath,</l>
                     <l>His Life may properly be called Death.</l>
                  </q> The Life that now is (as much as we make of our ſelves) is not a thing worth the taking up, were it not in purſuance of, and in order to ſomething better, as the vulgar Note well obſerves:
<q>
                     <l>Can Life be a Bleſſing,</l>
                     <l>And worth the poſſeſſing,</l>
                     <l>If Love were away? O no, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q> The Practice of which principal part of Piety, or <hi>Juriſprudence,</hi> upon this Stage of <hi>Philanthropy,</hi> and the full fruition of the beatifick Viſion, who is defined to be Love in the Abſtract, is that which is our main Buſineſs here, and which only makes Life conſiderable, and Death not ſo dreadful as deſirable.</p>
               <p>The very heathen Philoſophers, that had not ſo clear a Proſpect of the future State, made no Bones (as we ſay Prover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bially) of it, as Sir <hi>Fra. Bacon</hi> in his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Eſſays gives us many Inſtances: Fear induced ſome to court it; Love and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip others; others in Complements and generous Bravado's, as <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his Wife <hi>Livia,</hi> at his Execution
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62259:82"/> takes his leave of her and the World toge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther, thus:

                     </l>
                  </q> That is to ſay,
<q>
                     <l>Remember <hi>(Livia)</hi> our things Conjugal,</l>
                     <l>Live and proſper, fare thee well.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It's the Conſequences of it are ſo formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable and aſtoniſhing, and not it ſelf, which is nothing but a deprivation of ſomething, which is as natural and as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for us to part with as to enjoy. Whoever leads a Juriſprudent Life, need never dread never ſo ſudden Death. It's for Fools (and guilty Knaves) to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of their own Shadows, and not for men of Temper and Diſcretion. Life is here a thing only conſiderable in order to ſomewhat better and future; Death is (if rightly conſider'd on) at beſt but a tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to another State (not Place) if ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to Intelligent or juriſprudent Agents.

               <p>MAn is defined very properly to be <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal ſociabile,</hi> a ſociable, or conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Creature, more than any other infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Animal whatever: the Tongue and Diſcourſe gives him that Preheminence, to make better gueſſes at another's meaning and mind, and the complexion of their Thoughts, than other Animals overt Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons indicate. Without Converſation (So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety is non-ſence, and) the World wou'd not be like it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solomon,</hi> the grand <hi>Juriſprudent,</hi> has long ago remarked it, That infinite Wiſdom created one thing to correſpond with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and it was told us, <hi>ab initio,</hi> firſt in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, that it was not fit or good for Man to be without Society, and thereupon his Maker did ſuperadd <hi>Eve</hi> for his companion, or aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:62259:83"/> that nothing might pretend to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent but himſelf. Whence it follows neceſſarily, That anchoretick Doctrine and Diſcipline is quite out of doors, both hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodox and immoral, as well as unnatural and ſelfiſh. Hence ſaid the ſame ſage and authentick Author, That two are better than one, for the ſake of reciprocal Aids, as well as Enjoyments; even Affliction is ſweetn'd by Society, much more Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; according to the true old Saying,
<q>
                     <l>Solamen miſeris ſocios habuiſſe doloris.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And a Man is known and underſtood by his Company that he frequents, when he is not by his own Deportment. So is the trite Saying,

                        <hi>Noſcitur ex comite, qui non cognoſcitur ex ſe.</hi>

                  </q> Hermitages, and Cells, and Solitudes, help much to qualifie a Man <hi>(vicibus alternis)</hi> by fits and turns for Converſation. So did our grand Exemplar <hi>Emanuel,</hi> often with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw into Deſerts and other Receſſes, but it was to recollect himſelf, with more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to appear upon the Stage, and to converſe with the Multitude, Publicans and Sinners, with whom we know he was ſo frequent and familiar, as well as with Magiſtrates, and Perſons of better Quality, otherwhiles that he was by the high-minded Scribes and Phariſees, reproached with the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62259:84"/> Character of being a Friend of theirs of meaner Extract.</p>
               <p>But wholly to ſequeſter a man's ſelf from all manner of Converſation abroad, as thoſe do that pretend to enter into Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, (which indeed is more properly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their leaves of it) is altogether againſt the Principles of our <hi>Juriſprudent,</hi> and his Practice too. Both Extreams are odious and dangerous, Never to be out of a Crowd, and never to be out of a Cell, or Dormitory; and it's as much to a man's own Edification and Improvement as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that he exert, impart, converſe, and communicate. <hi>Qui docet, diſcit:</hi> Whoever teaches others, learns himſelf; but he that hides himſelf in a Hole, or buries his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in a Napkin, is a Sot, and doth that which as a moral Agent is unaccountable.

               <p>But we muſt be very cautelous and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect (on the other ſide) what ſort of Company we keep; for as Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on generally is the quickeſt, moſt natural and laudable way of Improvement, if well managed, ſo nothing is more pernicious than ill Company; that's the Bane of moſt men, for want of Juriſprudence, or Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; not but that a man by the help of <hi>(Lingua penna mentis muta)</hi> that ſilent
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62259:84"/> tongue of the Mind, as a Pen is call'd, may render himſelf ſociable and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when he perhaps can't perſonally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear among Company, as it's many a Man's caſe beſides my own, in ſuch caſes Mahomets will walk to the Mountain, where the Mountain can't come to them to converſe. <hi>Abraham Cowly</hi> has well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, that an honeſt <hi>Juriſprudent</hi> Intereſt in the Campaign or crouded Company, (which is worſe of the two Extreams than perfect Solitude) muſt either make himſelf ſometimes appear like a Knave, or they'l make him appear like a Fool; beſides he is in danger of Infection with them, or to be trodden down by them, wherefore this Extream of Converſation, is worſe than a Secluſion. It's a critical point therefore of Juriſprudence, to avoid the two foreſaid Extreams; the Society of, and humane Converſe with intellectual voluntary A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents (ſuch as Angels and Men are, if we take them in <hi>puris naturalibus,</hi> and not in a lapſed or degenerate Notion, as both of them may be) is the greateſt Dignity and Duty of Mankind; the <hi>Juriſprudent</hi> Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliel of all the Apoſtles, intimates his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion fully in the Point, where he exorts us ſtrenuouſly to Hoſpitality, and annexes that ſingular Motive to it, that ſome Folks have thereby accidentally converſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, or giv'n Entertainment to Angels; but
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:62259:85"/> ſaith he, what e're you do, do not forget to communicate, or converſe liberally, for ſuch are excellent and highly acceptable to the moſt high, whereby appears plainly our Honour and our Duty. Who was more Sociable, Affable, Hoſpitable and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than the Lamb of God that takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Obliquities of Man? The firſt Miracle that he ever wrought, was at a Wedding Feaſt, where it appears the Gueſts eat and drank plentifully, which, together with his bleſſed Company, did much promote the Freedom and Benefit of their Society and Converſation; a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe and cynical Man no body minds or much regards, becauſe he is of an Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneal Temper and Converſe, ſelf-affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſingular, and that Converſation which is moſt Frank and Chearful, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundantly more Uſeful, moſt Healthy, moſt Innocent, and moſt Juriſprudential; and the contrary, when a Perſon is Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>green and Melancholy, or (as we Phraſe it now adays) out of Humour.</p>
               <p>Much more Good or Harm is daily done by Converſation among Men, than by all the Speculation or Information, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe in any thing in the World, for the Impreſſions made by Diſcourſe or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, are very much ſtronger than what is made by Precept, or Inſtructions any other way; and poſſibly that may be the

               <p>ACtion, ſaid Sir <hi>Rich.

               <p>Nor is any thing in Nature more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant (whatever happens to be profitable) than Variety. <hi>Certa lectio prodeſt,</hi> ſaid Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Seneca, ſed varietas delectat;</hi> Though a ſteddy Method of Studie is profitable; yet, ſays he, it's Variety which is delightſome or pleaſant. Nothing is more irkſome and uneaſie to an ingenious Agent, than one ſort or ſeries of Action, or expreſſions; it makes the Intellectuals giddy and obtuſe, like a Horſe in a Mill, whom to prevent that conſequence, we blind. Beſides the Pleaſure which Variety affords, it improves the Faculties that exerciſe themſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as experience (on our Reflexions) will demonſtrate plainly. <hi>Mens hominum novi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis avida,</hi> is an undeniable Principle, That Mans Mind is Naturally greedy of Novelty;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:62259:88"/> which in plainer <hi>Engliſh,</hi> is Variety that Man's Conſtitution ſo eagerly and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally affects; and therefore of Neceſſity it's more eligible and adviſable to habituate our ſelves thereunto. All things in Nature delight in and are full of Variety of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Action; as well the Sun, Moon, and Planets above us, as inferior Animals below; Winds, Weathers, and Tides of Water; all which may plainly indicate to us Humane Agents, the Expediency, Uſe, and Neceſſity thereof. Yea, the greateſt part of the Creation is contrived for Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety and Delight, more than Neceſſity, by that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or infinite Wiſdom variegated, as the great Apoſtle Phraſes it.</p>
               <p>Neither is there a livelier Emblem (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in the whole World) of Eternity and Immortality than variety of Actions here on Earth. No one ſingle enjoyment very often repeated, but cloys and ſurfeits Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity; but a variety whets or creates new Appetites.</p>
               <p>So great a Darling of Nature is Variety, that ſhe never exerts two Perſons or things exactly alike; no Mans Face, nor Mind, or inward Faculties are Mathematically parallel to another. And as no Man lives to purpoſe that is not active and vigorous, ſo none is to good purpoſe active, who is not addicted to Variety of Motion or Action.</p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:62259:88"/>
               <p>Among the <hi>Barbarian</hi> Naturaliſts, he that is leaſt liſtleſs, and moſt active and ſtrenuous, is their Chieftain or King, to whom they render readily and voluntarily all Homage and Allegiance imaginable.</p>
               <p>A genuine <hi>Juriſprudent</hi> is <hi>(ad omnia quare)</hi> ſquared and cut out for all laudible effects and purpoſes; and his Principles are to be vigorous and active, and to be full of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety and Action, as well as Speculation.

               </p>
               <p>I dare Challenge any <hi>Juriſprudent</hi> to give me a Preſident of any Man that ever was a Celebrated Author, or that earn'd a competent Fortune by doing (next to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is) onely one thing, or dealing in onely one Commodity, without cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity, as we ſay, or variety of Action: And I further declare it to be my Opinion, That no Man in the uſe of his Health, Limbs, and Wits, can be at a loſs utterly, for want of one or other Lawful Action; and (if it be not his own fault) variety. So great a Latitude of Action doth Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Neceſſities afford and crave, were the World much more Populous. And it's more Honourable and Religious, and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional to practice for <hi>pauper</hi>'s without any
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:62259:89"/> Fee or Sallary at all, than to be Idle in the Market-place.</p>
               <p>But if no more were in it of motive than the Health of the Body, and the tranquility and ſatisfaction of the Mind, and the prevention or diverſion of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of Snares and Temptations, that elſe will be ſure to put us at leaſt in exquiſite Jeopardy; it is well worth the while for a <hi>Juriſprudent,</hi> or <hi>Juriſimprudent</hi> to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd with variety of Action. It's better far to play at ſmall Games here, than to ſtand out; and it's not a moot point, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Action will turn to account, for I am (againſt the common Proverb) fully of Opinion, that ſuch a rolling-ſtone will gather Moſs; and that a regular and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent cruſing about the Creation (when you can't hoiſt your Top-ſail) <hi>terra, terra,</hi> from Coaſt to Coaſt, as the Phraſe is of our Maritine Authors) will turn to a good account. As <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> the great Orator of Old and profoundly Eloquent <hi>(eâ ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione)</hi> for that reaſon muſt needs be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to be, being asked, <hi>Quid primum? Quid deinde? Quid denique praecipuum in Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore?</hi> What's the firſt and main point of an Orator? His Compaſs. And what's the next great point, and what's the laſt, and moſt conſiderable part or point? An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd to them all three, Action. So to the Caſe, if it were put to a true <hi>Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent,</hi>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:62259:89"/> what's the beſt Councel to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to any Man to live honeſtly, and thrive heartily by; be would give it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his hand for a reaſonable Fee Action. Action, Action, againſt the World, and the more variety of them the better. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways provided they are of that ſort as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere not, or are inconſiſtent one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; which in truth was imply'd before in the Words prudent and regular Motions and Actions, and ſuch as are agreeable (more or leſs) to the reaſon of the things aim'd at; for a little Diſcord in Muſick helps frequently the Harmony; and by the ſame reaſon, may a little caſual eccen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricality of Accord, help more than hinder a prudent Enterprize, as a little Trip in a Race, often quickens and helps a Man by his Recovery to mend his Pace, and more vigilantly purſue the Cauſe and Concern of his main Chance, and win the Prize at long run.</p>

               <p>Joy and Pleaſures without any mixture or alteration of Pain and Sorrow, is only a peculiar Dainty reſerv'd for the next worlds Felicity and Enjoyment, and not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be met withall in this. But there is a Juriſprudential Joy or Pleaſure many times to be met with here, in ſuffering Pain, and loſs of Goods, as of old we read
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62259:91"/> of many that did, and in Self-denial for Righteouſneſs ſake; yea, to be overjoy'd in ſuch caſes, for the proſpect of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>

All pains in ſuch a caſe, will neither be long nor ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, but ſhort and light, and not worth further mentioning or taking notice of, in compariſon of both the preſent, as well as future intellectual Streams and Rivers of Pleaſure, that a true <hi>Juriſprudent</hi> can never miſs of the Injoyment of.
<q>
                     <l>Res eſt ſolliciti plena timoris Amor.</l>
                  </q> Is as true, as old, a Saying, that Love it ſelf is a very painful thing, and fearful.
<q>
                     <l>To love, it is a grievous pain,</l>
                     <l>And not to love, a greater is again;</l>
                     <l>But of all Pains, there's no ſuch Pain,</l>
                     <l>As for to love, and not be lov'd again.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This is properly verified of Effeminate Pleaſure, but a Maſculine <hi>Juriſprudent's</hi> Genius and Complexion is of an other gueſt Mould; for his Love renounces Fear and Pain; he loves any thing or Perſon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:62259:92"/> to the Merits of the Cauſe only, a Wrong or Tort pains him more than a broken Shin, and a righteous Sentence pleaſanter to him than a Roſe in <hi>June.</hi> Senſual Titillations or Pleaſures little affect him, but he's raviſht with Intellectuals; his tickling Motto therefore is
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Currat Lex, fiat Juſtitia; Ruat Caelum.</hi>

                     <l>This Letchery has no Diſgrace.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But to ſee Right run down in <hi>Forma Pauperis,</hi> makes him roar with Pain; for no greater occaſion can be given to a <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſprudent</hi> of Uneaſineſs and Pain, than to ſee Might overcome Right; which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, or to perceive by Tricks and Evaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, excentrick to all Rules of Prudence, any body to be morally maſſacred.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>In fine, the greateſt Pleaſure, and the greateſt Pain,</l>
                  <l>Is to love, and to hate the ſame again;</l>
